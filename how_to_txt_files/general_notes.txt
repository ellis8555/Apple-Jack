1. Note about image folder organization. gifs need to go in /src/img/gifs path as this impacts npm run serve paths due to file paths being set from the excel/json file. copy-webpack-plugin will copy these gifs into the /img folder when npm run build is run.
2. All other images are placed inside of /img folder.
3. if want to change main logo on home page need to edit the path within webpack.config.js HtmlWebpackPlugin.templateParameters.headerImage
4. if want to change sites favicon need to edit inside of HtmlWebpackPlugin.favicon path
