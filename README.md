site: https://hax94.com

Vanilla JS - site is for a season based league based on a browser game called Haxball. Haxball.com is the games website.

I will keep this site as vanilla JS while other projects will use some JS frameworks such as React.

Todos in no particular order:

- currently hosted on git pages
- will end up moving the data to a noSQL database
- game information to be entered directly from the webpage
- more modular files to break down some files into smaller component files
- improved file structure for improved readability
