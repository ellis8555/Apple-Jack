add the new table header in ./constants/consts/supportVars.js
name this column the same that the stat will be named in the teams stat maps that map to stats.
create the method that will write to each teams stat maps.
create the new method in ./scripts/classFiles/teams/helpers/teams/helpers
// notes from previously created stats methods
'this[writeToMAP]' is the reference to that teams map of stats.
console log this[writeToMAP] to see what stats there are and how to use these stats to produce other stats

Lastly import the newly created method into setTeamsIndividualSeasonsStatsMAPS.js
the path is src\scripts\classFiles\teams\helpers\teams\setTeamsIndividualSeasonsStatsMAPS.js
