site: https://hax94.com

Vanilla JS - site is for a season based league based on a browser game called Haxball. Haxball.com is the games website.

I will keep this site as vanilla JS while other projects will use some JS frameworks such as React.

Todos in no particular order:

- many improvments will be made on an ongoing basis to this beginning project of mine
- break down scripts and place into own modules
- replace innerHTML with node appending/removals
